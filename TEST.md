## Test

### Validation Services

#### [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

- [Index Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmangez84.github.io%2Fenjoytrivia%2F)
- HTML generated by JavaScript was validated by direct input and gave no warnings or errors.

#### [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- The [CSS](assets/css/style.css) code was validated by direct input.
- Apart from warnings regarding vendor-specific extensions and external stylesheets, the validation reported no errors or warnings.
- The vendor-specific extensions are used to control the colour of the range slider and switch button. CSS from Bootstrap is used widely in the project. 

#### [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

- [Game](assets/js/enjoytrivia-game.js)
    - The code for the game was validated by pasting the contents of the JavaScript file into JSHint.
    - The validation tool did not report any warnings or errors.
    - JSHint was configured with the following comments.

        ```
        /* jshint esversion: 8 */ 
        /* globals $:false */
        ```
- [Feedback](assets/js/enjoytrivia-feedback.js)
    - The feedback function was validated by pasting the contents of the JavaScript file into JSHint.
    - The validation tool did not report any warnings or errors.
    - JSHint was configured with the following comments.

        ```
        /* jshint esversion: 8 */ 
        /* global emailjs */

### Testing User Stories For New Players

- As a new player, I want to be able to get questions from a specific category.
- As a new player, I want to be able to choose the level of difficulty.
- As a new player, I want to be able to choose the number of questions.
- As a new player, I want to see a scoreboard that shows the number of correct and incorrect answers.
- As a new player, I want the option to end the game and start over.
- As a new player, I want to be able to play the game on my computer, tablet and smartphone.
- As a new player, I want to be celebrated if I answer all the questions correctly.
- As a new player, I want to clearly see the question and the choices available for answers.
- As a new player, I want the correct answer to be displayed even if I answer incorrectly.

### Testing User Stories For Frequent Players

- As a frequent player, I want to be able to increase the difficulty further with configurable time limits for the questions.
- As a frequent player, I want to be able to contact the developer of the game and give feedback.
- As a frequent player, I want to be able to start a game quickly.
- As a frequent player, I do not want to get questions that I have already had.

### Further Testing

### Known Bugs

#### Fixed

- Some questions returned from the OpenTriviaDB API contain [HTML entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) but these are decoded if the string is presented in the DOM. The variable used for the correct answer is not presented in the DOM, which resulted in that the comparison between the correct and submitted answer sometimes failed. This was fixed using a function that decodes the HTML entities in the string containing the correct answer.
- The jQuery [:contains()](https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/) selector used to mark the correct answer sometimes marked several answers as correct. This could happen if the correct answer is a substring of an incorrect answer. The bug was solved with the help of this [jQuery Forum](https://forum.jquery.com/topic/contains-but-i-want-exact-how) post.

#### Unfixed

- The game does not work at all in IE11.
- Some questions with very long content may grow into the button next to it.
- On iPhone with the Safari browser, one of the answer buttons is in a hovered state even if the player is idle. I have not been able to reproduce this since I do not own an iPhone.
