## Test

### Validation Services

#### [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

- [Index Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmangez84.github.io%2Fenjoytrivia%2F)

### Testing User Stories For Frequent Players

- As a frequent player, I want to be able to increase the difficulty further with configurable time limits for the questions.

### Further Testing

- The web application has been tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge by the developer. The tests show that the web application looks and behaves similarly on these browsers.
- Internet Explorer 11 has also been tested. Read more under [Known Bugs - Unfixed](#unfixed).
- Tests have been done on an iPhone 8 device with the Safari browser. Read more under [Known Bugs - Unfixed](#unfixed).
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) has been used for testing and debugging purposes.
- Throughout the development work, the responsiveness of the web application was tested continuously.
- Tests have also been done on the deployed version available on GitHub Pages.

### Known Bugs

#### Fixed

- Some questions returned from the OpenTriviaDB API contain [HTML entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) but these are decoded if the string is presented in the DOM. The variable used for the correct answer is not presented in the DOM, which resulted in that the comparison between the correct and submitted answer sometimes failed. This was fixed using a function that decodes the HTML entities in the string containing the correct answer.
- The jQuery [:contains()](https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/) selector used to mark the correct answer sometimes marked several answers as correct. This could happen if the correct answer is a substring of an incorrect answer. The bug was solved with the help of this [jQuery Forum](https://forum.jquery.com/topic/contains-but-i-want-exact-how) post.
- Some questions and answers have single words that are very long and can cause the content to overflow. [Google](https://google.com) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-wrap) helped me solve this issue.

#### Unfixed

- The two columns for the answer buttons can vary in size depending on the content. This may look strange in some cases.
- The game does not work at all in IE11. This will however not be a priority when the next version of the web application is developed.
- On iPhone with the Safari browser, one of the answer buttons is in a hovered state even if the player is idle. I have not been able to reproduce this since I do not own an iPhone.
